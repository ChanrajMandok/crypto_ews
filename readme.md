## Executive Summary
This repository provides infrastructure to monitor Binance Announcements based upon classified Keywords. 

This Program works by initially pulling from the BINANCE_NEWS_DICT_URL to get a comprehensive list of all recent Binance announcements. Then it utilises Key Word Classification via Regex to identify Keywords which have been specified in the EnumLowAlertWarningKeyWords & EnumHighAlertWarningKeyWords Files and returns a List of BinanceRawArticle objects which included the keywords. 
After this classification, the program pulls the entire raw announcements, parsing it into a ModelBinanceEvent and further checking the HTML for specific information such as affected tickers, affected currencies, event priority, event category and token trading status during event. This acts as a secondary filter to ensure that the announcement is pertinent to trading operations. Event priority is assigned based upon if the affected currencies & affected tickers are listed within SPOT_CURRENCIES and USDM CURRENCIES [these Env variables reflect Pairs currently listed within Wirex].

Finally, these ModelBinanceEvent Objects are saved to DB, this DB is managed by a consumer which views at a ModelBinanceEventâ€™s important dates, if this date is less that the current timestamp, it will check for unicity and then send the ModelBinanceEvent.ms_teams_message into the Webhook_URL.
